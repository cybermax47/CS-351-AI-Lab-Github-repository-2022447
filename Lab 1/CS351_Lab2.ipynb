        "# Snake Chasing Food Game\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to the Snake Chasing Food game! In this game, the snake starts at the top-left corner of a grid and chases multiple pieces of food while avoiding obstacles. The snake grows as it eats food, and the goal is to collect all the food items while navigating through the obstacles.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "- *Dynamic Snake Movement*: The snake grows as it eats food.\n",
        "- *Multiple Foods*: Multiple food items are placed on the grid.\n",
        "- *Obstacles*: Randomly placed obstacles that the snake must avoid.\n",
        "- *Score Tracking*: The player's score is updated based on the number of food items collected.\n",
        "- *Game Over Conditions*: The game ends if the snake cannot find a path to any remaining food or if all food items are collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Instructions\n",
        "1. Enter the grid size.\n",
        "2. Specify the number of obstacles to place.\n",
        "3. Specify the number of food items to place.\n",
        "\n",
        "The game will then display the grid and the path taken by the snake to collect the food items."
