## **Lab#06: Clustering Techniques**

### **Objective**
To implement and compare clustering techniques (k-Means and Hierarchical Clustering) for grouping similar data points in the Iris dataset.

### **Steps Included**

1. **Data Setup**:
   - Load the Iris dataset with its numerical features.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Normalize the dataset using Min-Max Scaling to ensure all features are on the same scale.
3. **k-Means Clustering**:
   - Partition the dataset into 3 clusters using the k-Means algorithm.
4. **Hierarchical Clustering**:
   - Use Agglomerative Clustering to form hierarchical clusters.
   - Visualize the cluster hierarchy using a dendrogram.
5. **Visualizations**:
   - Create scatter plots to visualize clusters formed by both methods.
6. **Comparison**:
   - Analyze the clusters formed by both methods and compare them with the ground truth labels.

### **Key Outputs**
- Dendrogram for Hierarchical Clustering.
- Scatter plots for k-Means and Hierarchical clustering.
- Cluster analysis results and comparison with ground truth.

### **How to Run**
- Copy the code into a Jupyter Notebook or Colab.
- Ensure required libraries (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, and `scipy`) are installed.
- Run the notebook step by step.
